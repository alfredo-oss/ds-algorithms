"""
input: List[int] # represents a list of integers
output: int # returns the integer that is repeated the most times

notes:
-----
-> solving the problem without modifying the array and using
   only constant space is a must (can't create any other
   data structures)

-> no sorting
* consider that the elements ARE in range [1, n], if they were unique
  that range should be present.

example:
--------
[1, 3, 4, 2, 2]
